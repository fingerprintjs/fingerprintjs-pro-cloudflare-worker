# Contributing to FingerprintJS Pro Cloudflare Worker

## Working with code

We prefer using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for installing dependencies and running scripts.

The `main` and `develop` branches are locked for the push action. 

`main` branch is always where we create releases. If you have CF Integration set up, the source code is from the `main` branch. 

`develop` branch can be taught of as candidate for the next release. The code always passes the tests in `develop` branch. 

For proposing changes, use the standard [pull request approach](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). It's recommended to discuss fixes or new functionality in the Issues, first.

Create pull requests for `develop` branch. No pull requests to `main` branch will be accepted.

### How to build
After cloning the repo, run `yarn install` to install packages.

Run `yarn build` for creating a build in `dist` folder. After building, `dist/fingerprintjs-pro-cloudflare-worker.esm.js` file is created, and it is used to deploy to CF.

### How to run locally

Install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#1-install-wrangler-workers-cli) provided by Cloudflare.

‚ùóPlease use `Wrangler 2` instead of `Wrangler 1`. For more info, please visit [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/compare-v1-v2/).

First run `wrangler login`. This will open the browser and ask you to log in to your CF account to authorize Wrangler in your local machine. You can use `wrangler logout` any time to log out.

Then, you can run `wrangler dev` to run the worker locally. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:8787` and will have the following endpoints:
- `/cf-worker/agent` for downloading the Pro Agent script (a.k.a `import` url or `scriptUrlPattern`)
- `/cf-worker/getResult` for getting the result (a.k.a. `endpoint`)

You can use the worker locally with a client like the example below:
```html
<script>
  // REPLACE <API_KEY>
  const fpPromise = import('http://localhost:8787/cf-worker/agent?apiKey=<API_KEY>') 
    .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load({
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:8787/cf-worker/getResult'
    }))

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => {
      // This is the visitor identifier:
      const visitorId = result.visitorId
      console.log(visitorId)
    })
</script>
```

### Code style

The code style is controlled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Run to check that the code style is ok:
```shell
yarn lint
```

You aren't required to run the check manually, the CI will do it. Run the following command to fix style issues (not all issues can be fixed automatically):
```shell
yarn lint:fix
```

### Commit style

You are required to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) rules.

### How to test

#### Unit tests

Run `yarn test`.

#### e2e tests

End-to-end tests are run automatically on every PR. They also run daily on the `main` branch.

End-to-end tests are located in the `test/e2e` folder and run by [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) environment. 
The `teste2e.yml` workflow is responsible for deploying a new Cloudflare worker, running end-to-end tests, and cleaning up the worker in the end. `teste2e.yml` works like this:
1. Check out the current branch (can be any branch).
2. Bump version according to the input, default to `patch`.
3. Generate environment variables, such as `WORKER_NAME` and `GET_RESULT_PATH`. Put them inside `wranger.toml`.
4. Publish the worker using `cloudfare/wrangler-action` to the designated Cloudflare account.
5. Install `playwright`.
6. Run `yarn test:e2e` with env variables `test_client_domain`, `worker_version`, `worker_path`, `get_result_path`, and `agent_download_path`.
7. Delete the published Cloudflare worker from the Cloudflare account.

If tests fail, the last step (cleaning up the worker) is never executed by design, so that there is opportunity to inspect the worker to understand what went wrong.
Do not forget to delete the worker manually after using the Cloudflare dashboard. You can find the name of the worker in the workflow logs.

If the required environment variables are supplied, `yarn test:e2e` can be run locally without needing `teste2e.yml`.

### How to release a new version

The workflow `release.yml` is responsible for releasing a new version. It has to be run on `develop` branch, and at the end it will create a release and a PR to `main` branch.

### How to keep your worker up-to-date

CF Integration by Fingerprint always uses the latest stable version for the customers, and upgrades customer workers automatically.
